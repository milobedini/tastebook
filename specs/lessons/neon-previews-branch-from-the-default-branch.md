# Neon makes previews from the project's default branch

- **Added:** 2026-10-29 · **Applies to:** triage | spec | implement | review · **Issue:** TAS-100
- **Rule:** The Neon-managed Vercel integration has no setting for the branch a preview's database is made from: it always branches from the Neon project's default branch. To change it, pin the integration's **Production branch** (Neon console › Integrations › Vercel › Manage › Branches) to `main` first, then make the other branch the project's default, then redeploy production to check it still uses `main`. Never write a doc, spec or step that names a provider's setting without checking it exists in the provider's docs ([Neon-managed integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration)).
- **Why:** On TAS-100, PR #96's first setup step told the person to set "the branch previews are made from" in the integration's settings, which doesn't exist; a person guessing could have moved production's database instead. Review round 1 caught it.
