# Glossary

The words Tastebook uses, what each means, its name in code and the area that owns it. Code, UI copy, specs, issues and PRs use these names. Add a term in the PR that introduces it; change one here first, then everywhere it's used.

Names marked _planned_ don't exist in the code yet; use them when you build the thing.
